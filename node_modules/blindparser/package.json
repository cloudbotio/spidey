The purpose of blindparser is to allow for the important parts of the feeds (article titles, links, etc) to be returned in a standard format, but to also return the rest of the feed in a reasonable way.\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\nLike all node.js modules, just use npm!\n\n```\nnpm install blindparser\n```\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nUsing blind parser is easy, just call:\n\n```\nvar parser = require('blindparser');\n\n// with no options\nparser.parseURL('http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss', function(err, out){\n\tconsole.log(out);\n});\n\nvar options = {\n\tfollowRedirect: false,\n\ttimeout: 1000\n};\n//rss feeds\nparser.parseURL('http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss', options, function(err, out){\n\tconsole.log(out);\n});\n//atom feeds\nparser.parseURL('http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10861780/posts/default', options, function(err, out){\n\tconsole.log(out);\n});\n```\n\nOptions\n-------\n\nThe options hash is passed through to [request](https://github.com/mikeal/request) for fetching a given url.\n\nOutput\n------\n\nThe point of `blindparser` is to try and hide the format of the originally requested feed. Thus RSS and ATOM feeds are returned in a common format. Similar fields (pubDate vs update) will be mapped to the same field in the output.\n\nThe 'minimal' output format is:\n\n```\n{\n\ttype:\"rss\" or \"atom\"\n\tmetadata:{\n\t\ttitle: Title of the feed\n\t\tdesc: description or subtitle\n\t\turl: url of the feed\n\t\tupdate: pubDate or update time of the feed\n\t},\n\titems:[\n\t\t{\n\t\t\ttitle: Title of article\n\t\t\tdesc:\tDescription or content of article\n\t\t\tlink: Link to article\n\t\t\tdate: Time article was published\n\t\t}...\n\t]\n```\n\nTests\n-----\n\nTests for blindparser can be run using the command:\n\n```\nnpm test\n```\n\nMake sure that you machine has an internet connection before running the\ntests.\n\nLicense\n-------\nCopyright (c) 2012 Tim McGowan (dropdownmenu)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
